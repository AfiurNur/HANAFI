            <p class="hero-subtitle" id="heroSubtitle">HANAFI exists to empower the bold, elevate everyday expression,
                and bridge cultural identity with contemporary style.</p>
            <p class="hero-para para-one" id="heroPara1">"HANAFI exists to empower the bold, elevate everyday
                expression, and bridge cultural identity with contemporary style. We create statement pieces for the
                unapologetic — those rewriting their story, not fitting into one. Rooted in precision, purpose, and
                presence, HANAFI isn't just worn — it's lived."</p>
            <p class="hero-para para-two" id="heroPara2">For the culturally conscious, creatively driven generation —
                HANAFI is a fashion brand that delivers intentional, sharp-edged design made to reflect individuality,
                ambition, and legacy. Our goal: to define what it means to show up and stand out — not in trend, but in
                truth.</p>
            <!-- <p class="hero-para para-three" id="heroPara3">Who It's For (Audience Profile): Age: 18–35. Mindset:
                Creators, early adopters, movement-starters, rebels with taste. Values: Culture, expression, ownership
                of narrative. Style: Elevated streetwear meets high-concept minimalism. Lifestyle: City-centric,
                socially aware, digitally native.</p> -->
            <p class="hero-para para-four" id="heroPara4">Expression over Convention: Every piece tells a story — yours.
                Cultural Fusion: Designed for those who live at the intersection of tradition and now. Unapologetic
                Energy: We champion confidence, not conformity. Precision in Craft: From fabrics to fit, nothing is
                random. Legacy-Driven: HANAFI is more than fashion — it's movement-building.</p>
            <p class="hero-para para-five" id="heroPara5">HANAFI began not as a clothing line, but as a question: "What
                does it mean to stand for something — and still evolve?" The name HANAFI is rooted in legacy. Derived
                from the Arabic word ḥanafiyyah, it evokes integrity, clarity, and standing with conviction — even when
                HANAFI isn't just
                what you wear. It's what you carry with you.</p>
